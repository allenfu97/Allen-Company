Dear Chelsea,
Instead of having a driver .cpp, I asked Vipra before if I can run the program through my main class company.cpp, which I included
all cpp so if you hit the run button in company.cpp it will run the whole program. Hope this method is easier for you to run.
I worked really hard on the project and hope you enjoy it!
